# Subsystems

### Drive Subsystem
This subsystem is in charge of controlling the robots general mobility. The core funtionality includes teleoperated driving modes and interfacing with general purpose position or orientation sensors connected to the motor controllers. Other autonomous functions to control robot positioning are also implemented here.
